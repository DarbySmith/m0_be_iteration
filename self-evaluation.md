# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `each` method?
    * I feel like I need more practice. I do not feel super confident going through it.
- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
    * I felt very pushed. I had an unproductive struggle while going through the practice. The solution was much simpler than I thought. I was frustrated, so I was not thinking clearly and logically.
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
    * I need to review this lesson and the conditionals. I am going to take extra time in the morning before the stand up to dedicated review.
- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
    * I do not have any questions, but I need to go over the material myself again.
